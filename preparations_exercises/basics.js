console.log('5' + 10) //this returns '510' since it there is a + and a string

console.log(5 + 10) //this returns 15 since both inputs are numbers

console.log(Number('5') + 10) //shows another way you can log this so that '5' is calculated as a number and not a string

let petNames = ['asta', 'butterscotch', 'pudding', 'neptune', 'darwin'];
//The code above creates an array that lists pet names
